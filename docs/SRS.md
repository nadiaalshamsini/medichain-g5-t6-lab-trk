---

## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to define the functional and non-functional requirements for the Sample Tracking Module (LAB-TRK). This module is a core component of the Medichain Hospital Management System, specifically designed to monitor the lifecycle of medical samples.
​The intended audience for this document includes:
​.The Development Team: To guide the implementation of the backend logic (Node.js/PostgreSQL) and frontend interfaces.
​.The Integration Team (Team Leaders): To ensure seamless communication between LAB-TRK and other modules like Medical Approval (MED-APP).
​.Lab Administrators & Technicians: To verify that the system accurately reflects the physical laboratory workflow and security protocols.
### 1.2 Scope
* **Instruction:** The Sample Tracking Module (LAB-TRK) is a specialized subsystem within the Medichain platform designed to automate and monitor the internal movement of medical samples. The system ensures that every sample is accounted for from the moment of receipt until the final locking of the record.
  * Traceability: Providing a real-time log of the sample’s location and current processing stage (Reception, Analysis, Review).
​Quality Control: Enforcing mandatory documentation of previous stages before allowing transition to a new phase.
​Performance Monitoring: Automatically calculating the time spent in each stage and alerting administrators to any delays.
​Data Integrity: Securing the sample record once the review is complete to prevent unauthorized modifications.
  * **Crucial:** What the system WILL do:
​.Log Sample Transitions: Record every movement between laboratory stages.
​.Enforce Sequential Workflow: Prevent users from skipping stages or moving forward without proper documentation.
​.Automated Time Tracking: Start timers automatically upon entry into a new stage.
​.Alert Generation: Issue notifications if a sample exceeds the predefined time limit for a specific stage.
​.Record Locking: Permanently lock the sample data after the final review to ensure audit trail security.
​.Inter-Module Communication: Fetch material availability data and payment status from external modules to validate workflow transitions.
​What the system WILL NOT do:
​​.Financial Transactions: The system will only verify payment status from the Billing module but will not process payments or generate invoices.
​.External Referrals: This module does not manage the transfer of samples to external labs; that is handled by the External Referrals (REF-TRK) module.
​​.Chemical Inventory: The system will query the Inventory module for material availability but will not manage stock levels or reagent procurement.
​.Clinical Diagnosis: The system does not provide automated medical diagnoses; it only tracks the process of reaching those results.
### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
* **Instruction:** Provide a table defining all technical terms, acronyms, or domain-specific language (e.g., medical terms, API, ERP) used in this document so all teams share a common understanding.

### 1.4 References
* **Instruction:** List all referenced documents. This must include:
  * IEEE 830 Standard.
  * Links to shared architectural documents or API contracts agreed upon with the Integration Team.
